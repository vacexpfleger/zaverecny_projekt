Alternative Press,80,"This album isn't going to change the way you think about metal, but Killswitch Engange aren't Mastodon; they just want to get the pit going, and this album will surely acomplish that. [Aug 2009, p.108]"
Q Magazine,80,"The addition of Southern-fried sludge makes this album almost the complete New Wave Of American Heavy Metal package. [Aug 2009, p.101]"
New Musical Express (NME),80,Their future as a metal act with their fingers on the button seems assured.
AllMusic,70,"Where 2006's ""As Daylight Dies"" hinted at an accelerated focus on the more melodic aspects of extreme metal, Killswitch Engage cements the notion."
PopMatters,50,"Whatâ€™s especially frustrating for Killswitch fans is the fact that they know those tracks, which sound so weak on record, will absolutely kill in a live setting."
Billboard,50,"Aside from a few unique moments (""The Return,"" ""Take Me Away""), there's not much new to report here."
