The A.V. Club,100,"The result challenges brain and body, sure (just try headbanging to obZen), but it also dares any other metal band to write a more ferocious album."
Sputnikmusic,90,"obZen is a thoroughly enjoyable and engaging record, and is without question an early contender for metal Album of the Year."
Prefix Magazine,80,"So while there’s very little that’s surprising about obZen, the album finds Meshuggah’s strengths filtered through tighter song structures and more approachable grooves than we’ve heard from them in a long time."
AllMusic,80,"This is sheer attack metal, played by a band that has run from simplicity to excess and incorporated them both into a record that is on a level with anything else they've done, even if not all the elements marry perfectly yet. Just get it."
Alternative Press,80,"They're still crisp and cold--kind of like the Terminator--but somehow unlike Ahnuld, it's possible to hear a human heart beating within the steel. [May 2008, p.138]"
Blender,40,"The stiff, weirdly disengaged, single-note guitar solos and Kidman’s monochromatic death screams don’t make you want to keep dragging yourself through the record."
